# PhysicsComp
My original files and projects from my computational physics courses during my undergraduate coursework at the University of Utah. Most files are python scripts that solve physics problems or analyze data sets.

This includes final projects from Introductory Computational Physics Lab, Computational Physics I, and Computational Physics II. Not all code is thoroughly commented, but it was all created from 2021-2023. Not every file is thoroughly tested or foolproof. All .py files are compatible with Python3.6. All code is my personal original code, not derived from instructional material. Much of it was designed with very specific problems and data sets, and may not be applicable for other uses.

I hope that any of this material can help other beginnging python-ites like me develop and apply their skills to physics problems. These classes are where I first developed my passion for coding, and I hope I can always reflect back on these roots.
